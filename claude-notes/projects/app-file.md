# Project: the FILE application — `echo … > f`, power cycle, `cat f`

**STATUS: OPEN (started 2026-09-17).**  Design of record:
[`../design/app-file.md`](../design/app-file.md).  Read that first; this
file is only what is LEFT, lane by lane, and what each lane found.

The target: `App.xv6_app_adequacy` at `AppFile.app_file`, closed at the
literal image (`UFileBootAdequacy.file_adequacy_fileΣ`), with
`make audit-file-only` beside the echo and tree audits, and the
conclusion `FileDisc.file_phi`.

## Rules for every lane

- Build on the VM (`./gcp-rocq/run-on-gcp --check <file>` while
  iterating, `--proofs` before landing); never a local `make`.  Two
  builds in one remote tree race: lanes SERIALISE their `--proofs` runs
  (a lane may run `--check` at any time).
- No landed statement moves unless the lane says so here first.
  `AppEcho.v`, `EchoOut.v`, `AppInv.v`, `App.v` are read, not edited,
  except where a lane below names them.
- Every new result carries `Proof using`; the echo audit stays at 14 and
  the tree audit at 10.
- Report back: what landed (file, lemma), what was refuted and why, and
  the one thing the next lane needs first.

## Wave 1 — independent of the claim (run in parallel)

- [ ] **OFF-HAND** (kernel tier).  Design §3.  `FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok`
  stops pinning `OffParked`; the generic slot's mint takes
  `fdv_all_parked` of its key's table as a premise (sites: userinit at
  `fdt0`; fork's child — a generic parent's table is parked by its own
  premise, a verified parent parks first, `FdPark`; exec's taint arm —
  the U-tier exec leaf gains the premise and the caller parks); the open
  publish (`ProofSysOpenPub`) takes the mode from the deposit's open
  family (`off_pub_hand` at `hand`, unchanged at `park`); the three
  held-offset U-tier members: `UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_open_recv_img_held`
  (receipt at `FdInode i γo OffHeld`, `uoff γo 0` beside `ualloc`),
  `UkWriteFile.wp_uk_ecall_write_file_held` (the chain's fires at
  `off_supply_held`; `uoff` in, `uoff` at the advanced offset out on
  every arm, the `-1` arm advancing by what landed),
  `UkReadFile.wp_uk_ecall_read_file_held` (the R-c content row with the
  offset KNOWN: at `uoff γo off`, `d` bytes are `content[off..off+d)`,
  `uoff γo (off + d)` back).  Bar: every landed member's statement
  unchanged; echo audit 14; whole tree green.
- [ ] **SH-REDIR** (U tier, sh).  Design §5.1.  `UkShParseTok`/`Lex`: the
  `>` token; `UkShParseRedir`: the loop turns ONCE for ` > f`; `redircmd`;
  `UkShParseCmd`: `nulterminate`'s REDIR row; `UkShRun`: `ush_simple`
  admits `URedir (UExec _) file 0x601 1` at the top, and the REDIR arm —
  `close(1)` at the ledger, the `open` as a CALL PREMISE (a lemma
  parameter shaped like `wp_uk_ecall_open_recv_img_held`'s conclusion,
  at the ledger `[c; closed; c]`), the `open %s failed` tail through
  `UkShDiag` (a third `ush_diag_leaf` site), the recursion into the EXEC
  arm; `UkShFork.ushf_lexable` grows the shape.  Bar: the existing
  simple-line theorems unchanged; the new walk stated at an abstract
  open premise so it compiles before OFF-HAND lands.
- [ ] **CAT-PIN** (mechanical).  `iris/FsCatPin.v` = `FsEchoPin.v` at
  cat's inum and `ElfUser.cat_elf` (`FsImgCheck` gains `fname_cat` and
  the two `vm_eq`s); `iris/FileFsPure.v`: `file_fs_pure av :=
  echo_fs_pure av /\ era0_cat_pins av`, `era0` from the image;
  `FsImgCheck.fsimg_root_no_f` (the root's entry map has no `f`, stated
  on `TreeImg.img_root_blk`'s constant reading — user-tree.md §8.1's
  cost rule).  Bar: `Closed under the global context` but the
  PrimString primitives; no landed file's statement moves.
- [ ] **MODEL** (pure).  `iris/FileDisc.v` at design §1's definitions
  VERBATIM (the designer's; a lane that finds a definition wrong reports
  it, it does not fix it): `uline`, `line_bytes`, `parse_line` and its
  inverse laws, `disc_input_f` (prefix-closed, decidable, the snoc laws
  `EchoDisc` has), `echo_chunks`, `subseq`, `sel_ok`, `fst`, `fcontent`,
  `ralt` with its `nat` encoding and `ralt_ok`, `fsm`, `cont`, `sessf`,
  `fst_after`, `fadm_boot`, `good_out_f`, `disc_f`, `file_phi`; the
  determinacy `sessf_prefix_det` (the twin of
  `EchoOutPure.sess_prefix_det`, which is what the stage spends); five
  `vm_compute` demos including the echo/power-off/cat transcript and a
  crash mid-round.  Bar: `Closed under the global context`.

## Wave 2 — the claim and the suppliers (after wave 1; the designer writes `AppFile.v`'s definitions first)

- [ ] **APP-CLAIM**: `iris/AppFile.v` — `file_fixed`, `file_names`,
  `f_state`, `file_pred`, the transport (commit and boot, design §2),
  `file_boot`, era 0 at the image, the record `app_file` with every
  `xv6_app_laws` field but `al_programs` (echo's re-instantiated at the
  projections, the ledger and tag grown by §4), the taint/supply lemmas.
- [ ] **F-OPEN**: the child's open supplier from the deed
  (`TreeMove.tree_open_create_au` / `UInitCons` mould): the create arm at
  `None`, the exists+truncate arm at `Some _`, both at a length-0 prefix,
  and the U-tier corollary on the held-offset open leaf — three arms:
  fd 1 on the node with the deed at `Some []` and `uoff γo 0`; `-1`
  with the deed unchanged; `-1` with the deed at `Some []` (created,
  then `filealloc` failed).
- [ ] **ECHO-FILE**: `iris/UEchoFile.v` (design §5.2).
- [ ] **CAT-ENTRY**: `iris/UCatKernel.v` + `iris/UCatOut.v` (design §5.3).
- [ ] **STAGE**: `EchoOut`/`EchoOutPure` grown by `o_fh` and the line
  shapes (design §4); the ledger's line list and the tag's lb; `al_pow`'s
  seed; `Hphi` at `file_phi`.
- [ ] **SH-ROUND**: sh's fork lends the deed, the exit payload returns
  it, the prompt link records `o_fh`; `UShCat`; the dispatch on the
  line's shape; the REDIR child's proof at the claim (the open premise
  instantiated, the taint arm parks).
- [ ] **ADEQUACY**: `iris/UFileBootAdequacy.v`, `iris/FileAssumptions.v`,
  `make audit-file{,-only}`; the design page's §0 rewritten as landed.

## Findings (append as lanes report)

### CAT-PIN — LANDED (2026-09-17, commit `9fb054b3b`)

**cat's inum is 3.**  Read off the image, not chosen: mkfs packs the
root in `UPROGS` order and `cat` is the first program after `README`
(inum 2), so the root's record 3 is `(3, "cat")`.  Its record is
`T_FILE`, `nlink = 1`, `size = 36728` — and those 36,728 bytes ARE
`user/_cat`, byte for byte (`FsImgCheck.fsimg_cat_bytes_bool`).

**What landed.**

- `iris/FsCatPin.v` — `CAT_INO = 3`, `cat_path`, `cat_bytes :=
  ElfUser.cat_elf`; `fsimg_cat_size` / `_nlink` / `_nlink_nz` /
  `_size_bound` / `_type_nz` / `_type_nd` / `_file_bytes` / `_abs`;
  `era0_cat_path_pin`, `era0_cat_content_pin`, `era0_cat_arun`,
  `era0_cat_pins`, `era0_cat_pins_of_snap`, `era0_boot_cat_pins`,
  `era0_recovery_cat_pins`, `era0_reboot_cat_pins`; and the resource
  forms `fs_snap_era0_cat_pins`, `astate_era0_cat_pins`,
  `astate_era0_boot_cat_pins`, `nview_era0_cat`, `nview_era0_boot_cat`.
  `FsEchoPin.v` with `echo` → `cat` throughout and nothing else.
- `iris/FsFPin.v` — `f_path`, `fsimg_f_path`, the five
  `fname_f_ne_*`, `f_absent`, `f_absent_apath`, `era0_f_absent`,
  `era0_boot_f_absent`, `era0_recovery_f_absent`.
- `iris/FileFsPure.v` — `file_fs_pure av := echo_fs_pure av /\
  era0_cat_pins av`, `file_fs_pure_echo`, `file_fs_pure_cat`,
  `file_fs_era0` (the twin of `AppEcho.echo_fs_era0`: same three
  premises, `file_fs_pure (abs_view (fss_inodes S))`).
- `iris/FsImgCheck.v` (additive) — `fname_cat`, `fname_f`,
  `fsimg_cat_path` (`= Some 3`), `fsimg_cat_type`,
  `fsimg_cat_bytes_bool`, `fsimg_cat_at`, `fsimg_cat_ok`.  Each exactly
  where echo's twin sits; no landed statement moved.
- `iris/ElfUser.v` (additive) — `cat_elf` and the fifth copy of the
  program theorem set, on `echo_elf`'s pattern (pure-bss writable
  segment: entry 0xf6, loads `(0x0, 0xecc, 0xecc, R-X)` and
  `(0x1000, 0x0, 0x220, RW-)`, `.bss = [0x1000, 0x1220)`).
- `user-rocq/_CoqProject` — `CatElfRaw.v` joins the list.  It was
  DUMPED but deliberately unlisted ("nothing needs it"); now something
  does.  **The next lane that adds a program must do the same**, and
  must `rm` the remote `CoqMakefile` afterwards (`run-on-gcp --proofs`
  regenerates it only when it is ABSENT, so a `_CoqProject` edit is
  invisible to the remote build until you delete it).

**The `no f` sentence is `FsConsPin`'s, not `TreeImg`'s.**  The brief
asked for it on `TreeImg.img_root_blk`'s constant reading; it is not
needed and would have cost an import of `TreeImg` (hence `App` and
`AppTree`) into an image leaf.  `FsConsPin.fsimg_console_path` already
pays the identical computation for `console` — a MISS, so the full scan
— through `FsImgCheck.fsimg_path_root`, which is `FsImg.path_at_disk_dir`'s
single `dir_first` pass and not `dir_view`.  `fsimg_f_path` is that line
at `fname_f`, and it is not measurably slower than its neighbours.
`TreeImg`'s `img_root_blk` / `Global Opaque` machinery exists for
`dir_view`, which nothing here calls.

**Traps hit (one).**  `FsFPin` is a PURE leaf — no `iris.proofmode` —
so `rewrite /f_absent` and `rewrite -Hdk` (ssreflect) do not parse
there: `Syntax error: '*' or [oriented_rewriter] expected after
'rewrite'`.  Every pin file in this family imports `iris.proofmode` for
its own `iProp` sections and therefore gets ssr rewriting for free; a
file that does not must spell `unfold` / `rewrite <-`.  Worth knowing
for MODEL (`FileDisc.v`), which is Iris-free by charter.

**Assumptions.**  `Print Assumptions` on `era0_cat_path_pin`,
`era0_cat_content_pin`, `era0_cat_arun`, `era0_cat_pins_of_snap`,
`era0_boot_cat_pins`, `era0_recovery_cat_pins`, `era0_f_absent`,
`era0_recovery_f_absent`, `file_fs_era0`, `ElfUser.cat_elf_wf` and
`FsImgCheck.fsimg_cat_ok`: the eleven `PrimString`/`PrimInt63`
primitives, nothing else — no `Admitted`, no project axiom, no `Spec*`
module parameter.  Echo audit still 14, tree audit still the system
theorem's thirteen (ten Rocq primitives + the two reservation
`Parameter`s + `functional_extensionality_dep`).  Whole tree green
(`--proofs -k`, no `Error`).

**THE ONE THING THE NEXT LANE NEEDS FIRST.**  APP-CLAIM: `f_ok av None`
is `FsFPin.f_absent av` — use that name rather than re-spelling the
`astep`, because `FsConsPin`'s section 5 delta algebra
(`cons_absent_arm` / `_create_other` / `_unarm` / `_trunc`, and the
name-generic `file_pin_*` family beside them) is written against
exactly this shape and is what carries the claim through the mknod and
the create legs.  `FsFPin` deliberately stops before those: they need
`FsAbsDelta` and belong with the claim, and the five `fname_f_ne_*`
inequalities they take are already proved there.
