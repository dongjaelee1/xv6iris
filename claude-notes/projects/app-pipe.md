# Project: the PIPELINE application — `echo … | cat` prints the line

**STATUS: OPEN (started 2026-09-17, owner: "go for the pipeline
application").**  Design of record: [`../design/app-pipe.md`](../design/app-pipe.md).
Read that first; this file is only what is LEFT, lane by lane, and what
each lane found.

The target: `App.xv6_app_adequacy` at `AppPipe.app_pipe`, closed at the
literal image (`UPipeBootAdequacy.pipe_adequacy_pipeΣ`), with
`make audit-pipe-only` beside the echo, tree and file audits, and the
conclusion `PipeDisc.pipe_phi`.  Until lane PIPE-2W lands, the `PBoth`
arm is the theorem's one named premise (`pipe_both_law`).

## Rules for every lane

- Each lane works in ITS OWN worktree of this tree (`/shared/xv6iris-pipe-<lane>`,
  branch `app-pipe/<lane>` off the SHA the brief names) and builds ONLY
  on the EC2 mirror, in a fully built clone of the same name there,
  through `claude-notes/projects/app-pipe-briefs/ec2-lane.sh <lane>
  check|build|run` (which syncs first).  Never a local `rocq`/`coqc`/
  `make` (the standing order; this machine is the owner's, 8 cores/15 GB).
  Lanes do not share a remote clone, so they do not race each other.
- No landed statement moves unless the lane's brief says so.  `AppEcho.v`,
  `EchoOut.v`, `EchoDisc.v`, `AppInv.v`, `App.v` and every `AppFile*`/
  `UEchoFile`/`UCat*`/`UShCat`/`UShRedir*` file of upstream's FILE campaign
  are READ, not edited.
- Every new result carries `Proof using`; the echo audit stays at 14, the
  tree audit at 10, the system audit at 13.
- Report back: what landed (file, lemma), what was refuted and why (at
  the STATEMENT: mask, persistence, home across `fork`/`exec`), and the
  one thing the next lane needs first.  A refuted ruling is reported, not
  routed around.
- The coordinator merges to `main` from `main` (`git checkout main` first;
  print `git branch --show-current`), gates on a green `--proofs` of the
  merged tree, and pushes only on the owner's signal.

## Wave 1 — independent of the protocol (run in parallel)

- [ ] **PQ-FLAG** (kernel/spec, design §3.1).  `PipeQueue.pipe_wlink` gains
  the premise `⌜ps_wo s = true⌝`, `pipe_rlink` gains `⌜ps_ro s = true⌝`;
  every `_of_frag` constructor and chain lemma (`pipe_wchain`/`pipe_rchain`
  and their `_cursor`/`_neg`/post lemmas) re-proved by ignoring the
  premise; the two fire sites (`ProofPipewrite` at the `sw` of `nwrite++`,
  `ProofPiperead` at `nread++`) supply it from the caller's `pipe_ref`
  through `PipeInvDefs.pipe_endstate` (`:589`) and the coupled arm's
  `pflag_bool`.  If the ref is not in hand at the store, thread the pure
  fact from `SpecFilewrite`'s `f->writable` arm and report.  Bar: whole
  tree green, no statement outside `PipeQueue`/`Spec*Pipe*`/`Proof*Pipe*`
  moves, audits unmoved.
- [ ] **PIPE-REG** (U tier, design §2).  New `iris/PipeReg.v`: `pipe_reg γp
  := □ (∀ w, pipe_cpay (pn_queue γp) w emp)`, `pipe_row_reg`,
  `pipe_reg_of_taint`, persistence/timelessness; the VACUITY scratch
  `pipe_reg_not_free` first.  `UkRun.urun_nopipe` REDEFINED as `[∗ list] st
  ∈ fdv, pipe_row_reg st` (name kept; `urun_nopipe_intro` from
  `fdv_nopipe`, NEW `urun_nopipe_taint`); `urun_nopipe_step` off
  `usys_fd_ok` at `n <> USYS_pipe`; `urun_rows_insert`/`urun_rows_nopipe`
  restated at the resource.  `UexecExecInst.xv6_sbundle_exit_regs` (the
  exit row from the registry; `_nopipe` kept as a corollary) and its one
  consumer `UexecExecMint:151`.  `UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_pipe` drops the
  `□ riscv_kill_cred` premise and hands the run back OWED THE REGISTRATION
  (`pipe_reg γp -∗ urun …` in the post) — STOP RULE in design §2 if the
  run cannot be split; the fallback is a registrar premise.  Bar: every
  `iAssert (UkRun.urun_nopipe …)` site in the tree compiles unchanged (the
  list: UkFork:951, UInitSh:1055/1319, UShEchoPay:149/173/268,
  UexecCond:282/313/365, UShEcho:1347/1361/1437, UShKernel:560/801,
  UEchoKernel:457, UCatKernel:1111/1175, UShCat:869/976/1032/1048,
  UEchoFile:459/502, UInitBoot:1020, UInitTreeExec:373, UEchoOut:855,
  USyncKernel:186, UInitKernel:285/405); whole tree green; audits
  unmoved.
- [ ] **PIPE-MODEL** (pure, design §1).  `iris/PipeDisc.v` at §1's
  definitions VERBATIM (a lane that finds a definition wrong REPORTS it,
  it does not fix it): `pline`, `line_bytes`, `pline_ok`, `parse_pline`
  and its inverse laws, `disc_input_p` (prefix-closed, decidable, the snoc
  laws `EchoDisc` has), `palt` with its `nat` encoding (injective; `PBoth
  sel` encoded with `sel`), `palt_ok`, `pcont`, `merge`/`merge_prefix`,
  `sessp`, `good_out_p`, `pipe_phi`; the determinacy `sessp_prefix_det`
  (the twin of `EchoOutPure.sess_prefix_det`, on `pcont_shape`: every
  non-panic continuation is `$`-free then the prompt); the `vm_compute`
  demos §1 lists including the NEGATIVE one.  Bar: `Closed under the
  global context`.
- [ ] **SH-PARSE-PIPE** (U tier, sh's parser, design §5.1).  Mould:
  upstream's SH-PARSE / SH-PARSE-2 findings in `projects/app-file.md`.
  `parsepipe` turns ONCE for ` | cat` (today `wp_kshp_parsepipe_gt` is the
  `>`-shape walk); `pipecmd` into the node catalogue (`ush_cmd` at `UPipe
  (UExec l) (UExec r)`); `nulterminate`'s PIPE row; `parseline`/`parsecmd`
  at the pipe shape; the parser theorem at the pipe shape;
  `UkShFork.ushf_lexable` grows the shape.  NEW files where possible
  (`UkShPipeLex.v`, `UkShPipeParse.v`); the existing simple-line and
  redirect-line theorems unchanged.  Bar: whole tree green.
- [ ] **SH-PIPE** (U tier, sh's `runcmd`, design §5.1).  NEW `iris/UkShPipe.v`:
  `UkShRun.ush_simple` admits `UPipe (UExec l) (UExec r)` at the top; the
  PIPE arm walked with its non-code obligations as CALL PREMISES
  (SH-REDIR's `ush_open_call` pattern): `ush_pipe_call` shaped like
  `wp_uk_ecall_pipe`'s conclusion at the ledger `[c; c; c]` (p = {3, 4}),
  the two `fork1`s through `wp_kshr_fork1_any` with ABSTRACT lends `Rc`
  and payloads `Q` (parameters of the arm's lemma), the six closes
  (`wp_uk_ecall_close_std` at slots 0/1, `wp_uk_ecall_close` at 3/4 with
  the pipe rows' deposits as parameters), the two `dup`s into slots 1
  and 0, the two `wait(0)`s through `wp_kshr_wait0`, the `pipe`-failed
  tail into `UkShDiag.ush_diag_leaf`'s panic entry.  If a dup/close leaf
  pins `fdst_nopipe` on the installed row, REPORT (lane PIPE-STD takes
  it).  Bar: the existing `wp_kshr_runcmd` theorems unchanged; the new
  arm compiles at the abstract premises before PIPE-REG lands.
- [ ] **PIPE-STD** (U tier, design §5.4).  `UkReadPipe.wp_uk_ecall_read_pipe_std`
  and `UkWritePipe.wp_uk_ecall_write_pipe_std` at `UserFd.ustd` (slot 0 /
  slot 1), through `UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_read_at`/`_write_at` at `K fdv :=
  take NSTD fdv = l` with `UserFd.ustd_agree` (mould: `UkWriteFile.
  wp_uk_ecall_write_std` + `udepwf_std_write_file`, OFF-LINK's L5 block);
  the deposit twins; `dup` of a pipe row INTO a standard slot and `close`
  of a standard slot holding a pipe checked and, if a leaf pins
  `fdst_nopipe`, the pin taken off with its reason.  Bar: statements
  otherwise identical to the handle-fixed leaves; whole tree green.

## Wave 2 — on the protocol

- [ ] **PIPE-PROTO** (design §3; after PQ-FLAG + PIPE-REG).  `iris/PipeProto.v`:
  `pipeProtoG`, `pnames`, `pipe_body`/`pipe_inv` at (P1)–(P3),
  `pipe_reg_of_inv`, the writer's chain builder (`pipe_wpay` from the
  invariant at cursor `j` with `Q j` = the length-`j` lower bound, the
  last node's `mono_list_lb γws L`), the reader's chain builder
  (`pipe_rpay` from the invariant at cursor `c`, the EOF observation
  setting `γeof`), the allocation right after `pipe(2)` (`pipe_proto_alloc :
  pipe_qfrag (pn_queue γp) pst0 ={⊤}=∗ ∃ pn, pipe_inv pn γp L ∗ wtok γw`),
  and sh's end-of-round reading (§4.2's four cases as lemmas).  Consumer
  test: a straight-line `pipe → fork → (child writes L) / (child reads to
  EOF) → waits → the reading says the reader saw L`, at the leaves.
- [ ] **ECHO-PIPE** (design §5.2; after PIPE-PROTO + PIPE-STD).
  `iris/UEchoPipe.v`: echo's `image_entry` at fd 1 = a pipe write end.
- [ ] **CAT-PIPE** (design §5.3; after PIPE-PROTO + PIPE-STD).
  `iris/UCatPipe.v`: cat's round and `image_entry` at fd 0 = a pipe read
  end, at the pipe stage's cursor.
- [ ] **PIPE-STAGE** (design §4.1/§5.5; after PIPE-MODEL).  `iris/AppPipe.v`
  and the links record instance `PipeLinks`; `Hphi` at `pipe_phi`; the
  record's laws; `pipe_fs_pure`.  Mould: upstream's STAGE / STAGE-2 /
  FILE-DEC findings and `AppFileRec.v`.

## Wave 3 — the round and the theorem

- [ ] **SH-PIPE-ROUND** (design §4.2): sh's round at the claim — the
  main loop's dispatch on the line's shape (LEcho → the echo round
  unchanged; LPipe → `UkShPipe`'s arm instantiated at PIPE-PROTO's lends
  and payloads, ECHO-PIPE's and CAT-PIPE's entries as the two exec
  supplies), the end-of-round reading, the prompt.
- [ ] **PIPE-ADEQUACY**: `iris/UPipeBootAdequacy.v`, `iris/PipeAssumptions.v`,
  `make audit-pipe{,-only}`; the design page's §0 rewritten as landed;
  `pipe_both_law` reported as the one premise.
- [ ] **PIPE-2W** (design §4.3): the merge lease; `pipe_both_law` discharged;
  the premise removed.
